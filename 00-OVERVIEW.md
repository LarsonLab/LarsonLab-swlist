# Larson Lab Software List

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of lists. Each list collects names and references of software tools, packages, and resources commonly used by members of the Larson Lab in the Department of Radiology at UCSF for various low-level tasks that are broadly applicable to most group members. The formatting of this list as a git repository was done in order to facilitate the sharing, hosting, and distributed updating of these lists.
